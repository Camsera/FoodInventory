# TabProject
This project was a collaborative effort between myself and Luke Zinszer. 
We were aspiring to make an application that was the groundwork to a larger scale inventory application to be used by local food pantries for the sake of sharing and exchanging inventory.
The UI, Adapters, Fragments and connections were written by me. The base classes for different catergory objects and SQL Query was written by Luke.
Was intended to feature a food search functionality by querying a foot database API. There were issues implementing this feature. 
Will be added in the future.
